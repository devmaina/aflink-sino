AfLink-Sino - The Ultimate China-Africa Trade Bridge üåçüö¢
Overview
AfLink-Sino is a B2B & C2B eCommerce platform designed to simplify the sourcing, purchasing, and delivery of goods from China to Africa. We connect African businesses and individuals with trusted Chinese suppliers, ensuring affordable, fast, and secure transactions.

This platform is built using modern technologies to deliver a flexible, scalable, and seamless cross-border trade experience.

üöÄ Tech Stack
AfLink-Sino is built with the following core technologies:

Frontend:
Angular:
A powerful and dynamic JavaScript framework used for building the user-facing part of the platform. Angular handles routing, user interactions, and integrates with the backend to provide real-time data and functionality (like product listings, shipment tracking, etc.).
Backend:
Strapi (Headless CMS):
We use Strapi as a headless CMS to manage the platform's data, including product catalogs, user data, and transactional information. Strapi offers flexibility by allowing us to serve content to different frontends (e.g., mobile, web).
Database:
PostgreSQL:
A robust relational database for storing transactional data, user information, and other critical system data. PostgreSQL ensures data integrity and scalability.
Authentication:
JWT (JSON Web Tokens):
Secure user authentication and authorization via JWT, ensuring only authorized users (buyers, sellers, admins) can access their respective functionalities.
Payment Integration:
Stripe / PayPal:
Integration with Stripe and PayPal for secure, reliable payment processing.
Cloud & Deployment:
Docker:
Containerization of both backend and frontend services for easy and consistent deployment across different environments.
AWS / Azure (or any other preferred cloud service for deployment).
